### Track

We, WeTeam NIT Raipur, opted the 1st probelem statement given to us in the Hackathon Version Beta at MANIT Bhopal. The problem statement :
Create an application using google satellite view to find areas of a city which are most certain to be affected by flood. The application should not only identify those regions but also suggest an efficient order in which rescue operation can be carried out.
Our team innovated, designed and created the web application called "Flood Rescue". A web application using google satellite view (through Google Maps) to find areas of a city/region in the range of threat posed by a flood. We can find the most affected zones as well as the least affected zones. The application not only identify those regions but also suggest an efficient order in which rescue operation can be carried out. The web application also lists helpful link and contacts in case of an emergency. The website also promotes donations to the needy by providing links to the government/humanitarian organisations.
